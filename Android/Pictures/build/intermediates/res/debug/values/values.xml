    <string name="About">\n\nThis app can record data regardless of Internet or Wi-Fi connection. After finished recording data, the points you recorded will remain saved. Later, if you have internet connection, you can click on upload (a menu option located at the top of the app). This will show you the session name and time that your data was recorded. Clicking on the upload button will publish that information to iSENSE.\n\n </string>
    <string name="About_Title">About</string>
    <string name="Help_Title">Help</string>
    <string name="aboutApp">About:\n\nThis app enables you to share a photo, the location and time it was taken and to upload that data online. When the app is activated, you are given the option to take a picture, upload a picture from the gallery or continuously take photos. All data that is recorded can be shared on the iSENSE web system (isenseproject.org), where it can be viewed publicly. In order to allow you to find your contributed data easily, the app asks you to enter your first name and last initial. If you are not comfortable with this information being posted on the web, please refrain from using this application.\n\n
Instructions:\n\n
In order to begin recording and sharing data, first you must enter your first name and last initial. Next, you can click on the menu option that says \”Project\” to select the project you would like your data to be uploaded to.\n\n 

To Take a Photo: Press the button that says \”Press Here to Take a Picture.\” After taking the picture and adding a description to it, the picture and your data are recorded and then saved. When you are ready to upload your saved data, click on the Upload option in the menu.\n\n  

To Upload a Picture from the Gallery: Press the button that says \”Upload a Picture from the Gallery.\” Select the picture you would like to upload. The picture and data automatically save. When you are ready to upload your saved data, click on the Upload option in the menu.\n\n  

To Continuously Take Photos: Press the menu option that says \”Continuously Take Photos.\”  Make sure the checkbox is checked and then select the time interval in which you would like your data to be recorded. To start recording data, click on the button that says \“Press Here to Continuously Take Pictures.\” When you are ready to stop recording the data click on the button that says \“Recording Press to Stop.\” The pictures taken and data recorded will save. When you are ready to upload your saved data, click on the Upload option in the menu.\n\n  

To use the App via the Share Feature in Gallery: While viewing images in your gallery, you can use the share feature and then select the iSENSE Pictures App to upload that image and its corresponding data to the iSENSE web system. </string>

    <string name="syncTime">Synchronizing time is useful when using multiple devices to record data at the
	    same time.  By default, many Android devices\' clocks will not match one
	    another\'s, thus making recording data at similar times difficult.  However,
	    you have a choice to fix this issue by setting a device as a \"host\".
	    This can be done by hitting the \"Send\" button.  Upon hitting \"Send\", 
	    the time from that particular Android device will be broadcasted as a \"timeframe\"
	    that all other phones in the local network can receive.  However, in order for
	    a phone to receive a broadcasted time, that phone must be currently in 
	    receive-mode, which can be done by hitting \"Receive\".  In other words, if
	    you intend on receiving a host\'s time, you must be in receive-mode before the
	    host hits \"Send\". (By default, \"Send\" will also receive the time that you have 
	    broadcasted, should you be the host).  After pressing either \"Send\" or 
	    \"Receive\", a dialog box will tell you the time that has been received from
	    the host, along with the millisecond offset between
	    the received time and your Android device\'s actual clock.  If you do choose 
	    to synchronize time, recording data will now work off of the host\'s timeframe.
	    This now allows for simultaneous data recording across multiple devices at the 
	    same time.  Please note: synchronizing time will only work if all the Android
	    devices are connected to the same WiFi network.  Mobile plans (e.g. 3G or 4G)
	    generally will not allow for synchronizing time.  Also, synchronizing time may not be
	    allowed on some WiFi networks, but it generally works on small, password-secured 
	    WiFi networks.  Should you want to revert to your phone\'s local timestamp, you
	    can use the \"Reset\" button.</string>
